## Meeting Notes 2/6/23

Ami

- Agree on data structure
- Ami is emailing her new data structure
    - Robin will look at it on her own, then they will meet
    - Specify input for query/search
    - She feels angst over this question
    - She feels that data structure will influence how the query will be written
    - Doesn’t want to talk about this yet before structure is decided
    - Want to be able to search by **name**
    - Want to force user to say first name/initial and surname - they should split it up
    - Should be a box to say exact search or fuzzy search (hopefully)
    - Possibly should be able to search by **county**, **dataset/collection** - reconstruction era (post civil war) or colonial era (before 1820ish)
    - Returns should be modeled after ancestry.com with a subset of the attributes - but when you click on it you can expand it

Rachel

- MongoDB may not need to be through Reclaim
    - Reclaim has a great help and support ticket
    - Also helpful for maintenance
- If she wants it to be, I need HER to make a trial account with her login
    - She will make a help ticket for this
    - Check reclaim cloud entry page, check help forum
- Can we move forward with the proposal?
    - I’ll send the proposal
- No controlled vocabularies?
    - Controlled vocabulary-friendly
- Can you make a list of search inputs?
    - Ongoing conversation

Chunru

- Can data be from an outside source for an Esri dashboard? Seems like no…
    - Desktop software has some documentation for connecting to MongoDB
- How can we create a dashboard with no map, just tables?
    - Documentation on that is confusing, so Robin needs to ask about it
    - She thinks we can trick it to not use the map widget in the display
- Ami: can we embed code in the dashboard tool
    - 3 ways to get to the dashboard resources
    - One way: webbuilder/experience builder thing - definitely a widget to connect to external data
    - We don’t know how well the software connects to a mongoDB - older version did, does the new version?
- We will explore other options concurrently
    - Figure out Esri ArcGIS by Feb 20 or move on
- Do other options have a price cap
    - $200 per year max

To ask at Esri conference:

- Explain our goal and ask if it’s possible
- Specifically:
    - A non-map, table search dashboard - is this possible?
    - An Esri dashboard needs to access a MongoDB - is this possible?
    - Does Esri have a database function?
- MUST bring back concrete documentation or next steps for us to follow - a “yes” without explanations of how will not help us!
    - See above for these questions

To do:

- Send pdf agreement and ask for written confirmation of the agreement (R)
- Explore ArcGIS API for Python (A)
- Look at old documentation about MongoDB/Esri
- Ami will set up a meeting
- Rachel check reclaim cloud help forum (MongoDB vs. MongoAtlasDB for location capability later)
- Maybe think about how Robin would use MongoDBCompass to upload data
- Ami could make a file converter
