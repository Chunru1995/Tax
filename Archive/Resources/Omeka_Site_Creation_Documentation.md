## Omeka Site Creation Documentation

- Updates 3/16/2023
    - Using Installatron on Reclaim Hosting, installed an Omeka instance at the URL http://onesharedstory.org/records/
        - using version 3.0.3 (recommended)
        - administrator username: MSDS_OSS
        - administrator PW: #zGZ)d^8IQ86
        - administrator email: rwpatton@alumni.virginia.edu
        - website title: Records
    - can log in with credentials at onesharedstory.org/records/admin/users/login
    - added our data in the database oneshare_Junk (still logged in with Robin's credentials)
        - cleared database, uploaded the two new .csv files
        - to do this:
            - from oneshare_Junk location (click on it on the left), select import tab
            - select file (ex: Tax_Record_1782.csv)
            - make sure format is CSV
            - under format-specific options, check "The first line of the file contains the table column names"
            - click "Go"
            - click the name of the table on the left (probably TABLE followed by a number) to look at the data - everything should look good!
            - click the operations tab
            - under table options rename the table if desired (ex: I renamed table to Tax_Record_1782)
        - repeat this step for all tables needed in the database!
    - set up the new Omeka instance with the database
        - opened a terminal under "Advanced" in cPanel
        - it issued a warning to be careful since I could cause some damage from the terminal - proceed with caution!
        - steps within the terminal:
            - put me in the home directory with the username 'oneshare@outofstep'
            - changed directory into public_html with the command `cd public_html`
            - changed directory into records, my Omeka instance, with the command `cd records`
            - opened the file db.ini with the command `vi db.ini`
            - this opened the configuration file which showed that, after all that, the Omeka instance already had a database called 'oneshare_om4`
            - the username for this database is 'oneshare_om4' and the password is 'P.hmeqj5h9mneAIx5XD63'
            - to exit the file, typed `:quit<Enter>`
        - this indicated that I needed to simply upload the files into the database 'oneshare_om4' so I repeated the above steps for importing data in this other database under the 'om_collections' collection, except the column names had to be specified
            - this did not work!
        - back to the drawing board - back to editing the db.ini
            - username: oneshare_UVA
            - PW: OneSharedStory
            - dbname: oneshare_Junk
            - commented out the prefix line
        - that also did not work :( got an internal server error even when I uncommented the prefix line. Changed the settings back
    - I'm pivoting to try something called Laravel
        - the directory is records_dash, meaning that the URL is http://onesharedstory.org/records_dash/
        - version is 9.19.0
        - instance is called "Records Dashboard"
- Future Updates
