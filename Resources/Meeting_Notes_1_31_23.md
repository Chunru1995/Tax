## Meeting Notes 1/31/23

- Understand how Robin wants the data managed/presented - she wants name/event structure
- Need to run column name changes by her
- 2 options for searching (our opinion):
- Search for a name and configure the output to reflect name/event structure
- Restructure the data to reflect the structure first, then search
- Backend should change the date column into a datetime object on its own
- Add documentation for adding queries (for Robin to add queries)
- Dashboard tool available in Esri - ArcGIS
- On These Grounds has event types - look at controlled vocabularies documentation
    - Robin wants this kind of data management
    - It needs to be possible for this data to deal with people, places, and events like the OTG data and ancestry data
    - “Linked open data”
- Sounds like she wants us to anticipate the work of OTG, although it has not yet been completed
- Next steps:
    - She will send us the updated CentralVA1867 Property Tax spreadsheet
    - She will send us the 1782 Fluvanna Property Tax spreadsheet
    - She is not pleased that we used the data from the previous capstone - scrap that
    - Once we edit the data structure, will need to repopulate the database
    - Check Reclaim Hosting for MongoDB options
