## Meeting Notes 2/13/23

- Anticipating new data
    - Will future dates include days and months?
        - She wants to stick with focusing on the 4-digit year
- Ask for search inputs
    - First name/surname
    - Location
    - Range of dates
    - Record type (1782 property taxes for example)
    - Also want to search for other (non primary) names
- Remind to agree on proposal
    - She’s concerned that she won’t get what she wants based on our proposal
    - Wants to reword some of the intro stuff
    - Wants to remove the structure
    - She wants to pare down the document so that it only includes what we’ve agree on
    - Feels like the hosting is the only thing up in the air too, the rest has moved under our feet
    - She wants everything out that can be removed
- Show query
    - Yay Ami!
- Discuss our tool of choice - Starlette
    - Her sense: when the other guys completed their project, their interface was searching through a static representation of the data
        - Esri insights - code capable way to visualize data
        - You could use Esri insights on a static version of the data that you bring over to the Esri web services - she says she did this with Chunru
        - She thinks the other option - to write a particular kind of code to access the dynamic data - is above our pay grade
        - SOUNDS LIKE she is on board with using a different tool as long as it’s free!
    - Ideal response: hyperlink to record image, subset of data (name, year, location, ALWAYS RETURN event title)
    - Can we try to get output sorted by particular columns
- For future spreadsheets:
    - Month and day as separate integer columns needs to not have the word ‘year’ in it
- Hosting
    - Reclaim would be inexpensive (theoretically)
    - She wants to try Reclaim Cloud one more time!
    - But she seems kind of nervous about MongoDB… but starting to be convinced!


- To do:
    - Access the website, see where we’d put an html page (check for a port)
    - Reach out to Reclaim Hosting myself (Rachel) to solve the problem
    - Look up whether it’s possible to get Reclaim Cloud to host the database
    - Look up what the customer service is like for MongoDB and AWS
    - Reword proposal by tomorrow morning
