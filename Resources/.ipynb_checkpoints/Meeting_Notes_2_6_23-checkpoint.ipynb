    "Ami\n",
    "\n",
    "- Agree on data structure\n",
    "- Ami is emailing her new data structure\n",
    "    - Robin will look at it on her own, then they will meet\n",
    "    - Specify input for query/search\n",
    "    - She feels angst over this question\n",
    "    - She feels that data structure will influence how the query will be written\n",
    "    - Doesn’t want to talk about this yet before structure is decided\n",
    "    - Want to be able to search by **name**\n",
    "    - Want to force user to say first name/initial and surname - they should split it up\n",
    "    - Should be a box to say exact search or fuzzy search (hopefully)\n",
    "    - Possibly should be able to search by **county**, **dataset/collection** - reconstruction era (post civil war) or colonial era (before 1820ish)\n",
    "    - Returns should be modeled after ancestry.com with a subset of the attributes - but when you click on it you can expand it\n",

    "- MongoDB may not need to be through Reclaim\n",
    "    - Reclaim has a great help and support ticket\n",
    "    - Also helpful for maintenance\n",
    "- If she wants it to be, I need HER to make a trial account with her login\n",
    "    - She will make a help ticket for this\n",
    "    - Check reclaim cloud entry page, check help forum\n",
    "- Can we move forward with the proposal?\n",
    "    - I’ll send the proposal\n",
    "- No controlled vocabularies?\n",
    "    - Controlled vocabulary-friendly\n",
    "- Can you make a list of search inputs?\n",
    "    - Ongoing conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "Chunru\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can data be from an outside source for an Esri dashboard? Seems like no…\n",
    "    - Desktop software has some documentation for connecting to MongoDB\n",
    "- How can we create a dashboard with no map, just tables?\n",
    "    - Documentation on that is confusing, so Robin needs to ask about it\n",
    "    - She thinks we can trick it to not use the map widget in the display\n",
    "- Ami: can we embed code in the dashboard tool\n",
    "    - 3 ways to get to the dashboard resources\n",
    "    - One way: webbuilder/experience builder thing - definitely a widget to connect to external data\n",
    "    - We don’t know how well the software connects to a mongoDB - older version did, does the new version?\n",
    "- We will explore other options concurrently\n",
    "    - Figure out Esri ArcGIS by Feb 20 or move on\n",
    "- Do other options have a price cap\n",
    "    - $200 per year max\n",
    "\n",
    "To ask at Esri conference:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain our goal and ask if it’s possible\n",
    "- Specifically:\n",
    "    - A non-map, table search dashboard - is this possible?\n",
    "    - An Esri dashboard needs to access a MongoDB - is this possible?\n",
    "    - Does Esri have a database function?\n",
    "- MUST bring back concrete documentation or next steps for us to follow - a “yes” without explanations of how will not help us!\n",
    "    - See above for these questions\n",
    "\n",
    "To do:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Send pdf agreement and ask for written confirmation of the agreement (R)\n",
    "- Explore ArcGIS API for Python (A)\n",
    "- Look at old documentation about MongoDB/Esri\n",
    "- Ami will set up a meeting\n",
    "- Rachel check reclaim cloud help forum (MongoDB vs. MongoAtlasDB for location capability later)\n",
    "- Maybe think about how Robin would use MongoDBCompass to upload data\n",
    "- Ami could make a file converter"
