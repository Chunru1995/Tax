    "- Understand how Robin wants the data managed/presented - she wants name/event structure\n",
    "- Need to run column name changes by her\n",
    "- 2 options for searching (our opinion):\n",
    "- Search for a name and configure the output to reflect name/event structure\n",
    "- Restructure the data to reflect the structure first, then search\n",
    "- Backend should change the date column into a datetime object on its own\n",
    "- Add documentation for adding queries (for Robin to add queries)\n",
    "- Dashboard tool available in Esri - ArcGIS\n",
    "- On These Grounds has event types - look at controlled vocabularies documentation\n",
    "    - Robin wants this kind of data management\n",
    "    - It needs to be possible for this data to deal with people, places, and events like the OTG data and ancestry data\n",
    "    - “Linked open data”\n",
    "- Sounds like she wants us to anticipate the work of OTG, although it has not yet been completed\n",
    "- Next steps:\n",
    "    - She will send us the updated CentralVA1867 Property Tax spreadsheet\n",
    "    - She will send us the 1782 Fluvanna Property Tax spreadsheet\n",
    "    - She is not pleased that we used the data from the previous capstone - scrap that\n",
    "    - Once we edit the data structure, will need to repopulate the database\n",
    "    - Check Reclaim Hosting for MongoDB options"
