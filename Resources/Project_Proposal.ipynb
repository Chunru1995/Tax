    "# Project Proposal: One Shared Story MSDS Capstone\n",
    "\n",
    "Group Members: Ami Kano, Chunry Zheng, Rachel Grace\n",
    "\n",
    "Sponsor: Robin Patton - One Shared Story\n",
    "\n",
    "Advisors: Dr. Judy Fox, Ian Liu\n",

    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This document seeks to define the goals, objectives, work structure, constraints, and limitations of the University of Virginia MSDS Capstone project for One Shared Story (OSS). Over the course of the semester, this document will be a guide for tracking project progress and help to keep the project focused on its main goals. The end of this document outlines key deliverables and deadlines. After review by the capstone group, Robin Patton, and Dr. Judy Fox, this document will serve as an authoritative plan for the semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Goals & Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "From a societal perspective, this project is motivated by the current challenges in tracing ancestry in Virginia, especially for people of color and women. OSS seeks to address this difficulty by making historic county property tax records accessible and searchable for the public. Because people of African descent in Virginia were most often considered to be property prior to the Civil War, these individuals were not recorded in census data, but were recorded in personal property tax records, usually only by first name. After the Civil War, these individuals with surnames were first captured in county tax records, and the documents capture the employer or residence of the formerly enslaved. This data can provide clues that will link ancestors of color to specific places where they may have been enslaved. This project seeks to provide a database structure to hold county property tax records transcribed by volunteers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The concrete goal of this project is to create a functional, scalable, and searchable database for OSS. The database must have a functional backend and be hosted on OSS’ website. Further, it must have three dashboard applications: one for searching the database to locate records, one to transcribe data, line by line, from property records or other document types, and one to enter a spreadsheet of transcribed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important quality benchmark in this project is functionality of the database. Robin’s priority is a functional database. A beautiful dashboard application would be ideal, but is not the key deliverable of this project. The group will do our best to meet all requirements, but will especially focus on the dashboard functionality. As this is a student project and a learning experience for the members of the group, it is understood that the product will be professional-quality to the fullest extent possible, given group members’ experience and skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, tools for the database hosting and dashboard applications will not incur extra cost to OSS. The capstone group agrees to prioritize free or low-cost tools whenever possible. Robin will provide feedback as needed when tools are chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Scope Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Work Breakdown Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a graphic representation of this project’s tasks. Tasks are organized in a parent-child orientation, with parent nodes representing a particular part of the project and child nodes representing components of the parent task. Thus, the top layer represents the final product, the next layer down represents the four main components of the project, and so on.\n"

    "\n",
    "Below is a more detailed description of each component of the above graphic, along with deliverables listed. The most important deliverables for the project are under the database and hosting components of the Work Breakdown Structure. See the end of this document for a deliverable timeline of each deliverable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Database: Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Restructure per GedCom.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data in the database must be structured such that it may be potentially merged with datasets from other organizations. In particular, it should be compatible with Ancestry.com and LOD. This will entail a change in structure from the current tabular data provided by OSS to a JSON structure, in a manner that is similar to what is specified by the graphic below. *Deliverable: restructured data compatible with, or at least similar to, Ancestry.com datasets.*"

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "id": "1ac8019c-3c12-4315-8ede-0117c201c1b8",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "##### Adjust Column Names.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current data features, or columns, have names that make queries difficult to write. This metadata will be renamed to keep the same information present in the feature names, but remove any line breaks or unnecessary spaces. For example, the name “Father\\nof” would be renamed to “Father_of” or “Fatherof.” *Deliverable: renamed feature names in the database for ease of querying.*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Adhere to Controlled Vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The organization One These Grounds (OTG) has an extensively documented vocabulary of terms called a “controlled vocabulary,” with defined terms such as “Freedom status transaction: Transfer.” These definitions help to standardize the terms used to describe the life events of individuals represented by the data. The data must be compatible with this vocabulary. *Deliverable: OSS data using controlled vocabulary terms or adhering to the structure of the OTG data.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Database: Querying\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Write Name-Event Query.\n",
    "\n",
    "The query function for accessing and searching the database must return names in association with events. This can be expressed as a name-event relationship. In addition, the query must be flexible and capable of searching new datasets that are similar or identical in their features. This means the query should be general enough to search for names and events with data from a slightly different historical record. For example, the queries will be designed around the current available data, which is property tax records. However, queries should also function for other property tax records with similar feature names. *Deliverable: Queries that return names in association with events, and are general enough to accommodate new datasets.*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Document Query Writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The queries should be well-documented such that Robin can understand and replicate them, even modifying them when appropriate. *Deliverable: a well-documented query function with instructions for replicating and editing queries in the future.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Searching: Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Choose Tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal tool for all dashboards is a modified version of an Esri ArcGIS dashboard. Originally intended for location data and map display, the dashboards will not necessarily include maps, but will be configured to display search results and entry fields. This tool is preferred because it would incur no additional cost to OSS. If this proves not feasible, a different tool must be chosen. A good, user-friendly candidate is Tableau, a paid tool. *Deliverable: an Esri ArcGIS dashboard for search and data entry, or a Tableau dashboard after discussion.*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Configure Search Fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the search dashboard, which should be a publicly available application, search fields should reflect similar ancestry record search interfaces, such as the dashboard provided by Ancestry.com. These fields may be tweaked and adjusted in conversation with Robin. Important fields include Name, Location, and Event. *Deliverable: appropriate search terms on search dashboard for returning genealogy records by name, event, and location.*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Choose Output Display.\n",
    "\n",
    "The search dashboard should display results in an appropriately neat and clear manner. This could be a dataframe format or more structured, like the format of Ancestry.com. Other visualizations like charts or graphs are also possible. *Deliverable: a neat and readable search result display.*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Update Query as Needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the search dashboard and search fields are chosen and adjusted, the query function may need updates. This should be done concurrently with search term decisions and well-documented, as specified under the Database: Querying deliverable. *Deliverable: edited and documented query function as needed to accommodate search dashboard.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Entry: Field Entry\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Choose Tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "See Choose Tool section under Searching: Dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Configure Entry Fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "The field-by-field dashboard for data entry should have all necessary fields for entering complete row information from a historical record. These entry fields should be flexible and adaptable for new kinds of data, while also including standardized fields such as Name, Date, and Location. *Deliverable: entry fields should include standardized necessary fields and should be configurable to accept new entry field terms.*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Document Field Creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the database must be adaptable to new data types, entry field creation should be well-documented so that Robin can add new fields as needed. Ideally, this would be a capability that Robin has, but that is not available to all users of this dashboard for security purposes. This could either be a backend functionality created by adding code to the dashboard, or a functionality built into the front-facing dashboard that Robin can access. *Deliverable: well-documented method for creating new fields in the dashboard, accessible only to Robin.*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Write Needed Backend Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data entry dashboard must be appropriately connected to the database and enter data correctly. This will require writing functional code that correctly adds data to the database in a row-by-row fashion. *Deliverable: working data entry code for adding rows to a collection in the MongoDB database.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Entry: Spreadsheet Entry\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Choose Tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "See Choose Tool section under Searching: Dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Write Needed Backend Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data entry dashboard must be appropriately connected to the database and enter data correctly. This will require writing functional code that correctly adds an entire spreadsheet of data to the database in such a way that it will be accessible by the query function. Additionally, the format of the spreadsheet that is to be added has been or will be defined by Robin and OSS. *Deliverable: working data entry code for adding an entire collection to the MongoDB database.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hosting: MongoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Run Tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The database, once created, must be appropriately tested. This includes testing its scalability by adding new data and checking for the functionality of the query function, testing its performance, and testing its usability among other important tests. *Deliverable: appropriately tested and, when needed, fixed database.*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Set Up on OSS Website.\n",
    "\n",
    "The database needs to be hosted on the OSS website through its hosting service, Reclaim Hosting. Robin would prefer transferring it to the OSS site as soon as possible so that any issues can be resolved before the end of the semester. Robin is setting up a MongoDB capability with the OSS website for this purpose. *Deliverable: working database hosted on the OSS website.*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Document Maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robin would like to maintain the database herself whenever possible. The maintenance of the database should be well-documented to facilitate this. This documentation will be developed with Dr. Fox and Ian Liu, who have expertise and knowledge about maintaining a database. *Deliverable: detailed documentation for maintaining the database.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Exclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "This project intentionally excludes any work with location data that involves mapping, in particular with regards to the search dashboard. It also excludes access issues, like granting certain users access to different levels of control, except for Robin. This project also does not deal with attributing record ownership to particular sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project only involves datasets generated from tax property records from various counties within the state of Virginia. Data unrelated to tax records will not be included in our project. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is limited by time, as the team will complete their work on or before May 3, 2023. This constrains the project, as its scope must be manageable within this time frame. Another key constraint is Robin’s wish for limited expense in tools. While the capstone group can request a budget from UVA, the project must be done with a view toward the sustainability of the product for OSS in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is also constrained by the limited experience of the group with database hosting, creation, and deployment. As specified in the Expected Quality section, the group will accomplish the project to the best of their ability, using all resources available. Key resources include the help of Dr. Fox and Ian Liu, the TA for the capstone course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "The capstone group commits to being available and responsive in a timely manner throughout the week, Monday through Friday, during business hours. Weekends and weeknights will not be assumed available, but the group may be available during these times on a case-by-case basis. Responses may be delayed at these times. The group expects that Robin and Dr. Fox will also be available and responsive during business hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the project, the capstone group will communicate with both sponsor (Robin) and advisor (Dr. Fox) in a timely manner and seek to follow the requirements and advice of both whenever possible. In the event of a conflict in advice, Robin has final authority over project priorities, requirements, and goals. Dr. Fox has final authority over what is realistic and appropriate given our time and expertise constraints. \n",
