# Defining New Data Features to be Searchable

- When naming new data features, specified tags should be included in the feature name. Below is a list of the tag options:
    1. Person
    2. Event
    3. Date
    4. Source
    5. Loc
    6. Count
    7. Value
    8. Name
- If the feature contains any information pertaining to these tags, the feature name should include the tag. Below are a few examples of naming new features:
    1. A feature that contains a person's mother's middle name could be called 'PersonMotherMiddleName'
    2. A feature that contains a count of a person's children could be called 'PersonCountChildren'
    3. A feature that contains the location of the recording of a birth could be called 'SourceEventRecordingLoc'
- Remember that if the corresponding words are not included, the search function will be unable to identify that column as one to search.
