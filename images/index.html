    <h2>Exploration</h2>
    <h3>Proxy for Race</h3>
    <p>By comparing differences across person role, we found that ‘taxpayers’ report mostly on white males, while ‘resident and taxpayers’ report only on black males. The category corresponding with white males also holds more wealth on average, in keeping with the expected demographic of post-Civil war Virginia.</p>
    
    <h3>Enslavement Status</h3>
    <p>Prior to emancipation, many enslaved laborers had the same surname as their enslaver. In Virginia, some liberated former enslaved persons stayed in their place of enslavement as employees. The ‘confirmed’ category indicates a record of an employee who shares their employer’s surname. This indicates an individual who was almost certainly a recently freed enslaved person.</p>

    <h3>Scalability</h3>
    <p>As more data is added to the database according to the client’s work, this pipeline can be scaled up, making new records available and comprehensible.</p>
